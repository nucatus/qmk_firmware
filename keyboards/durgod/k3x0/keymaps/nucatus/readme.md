# QMK configuration with querty and dvorak layouts for durgor taurus k3x0

## Layers

### Layout #1

This is the querty layout with the Apple command key next to the space bar key.

### Layout #2

The dvorak layout with the Apple command key next to the space bar.

### Layout #3

This is a placeholder for the Programmer Dvorak layout that hasn't been implemented because
of the custom shift complexity. This implemantation should be tackled in future development.

## Switching layers

Each layer can be toggled using the Fn + {layout_id}.

## Non-standard mappings

1. CapsLock is remapped to LCTL, but a double tap would lock/unlock caps.
2. In both dvorak layouts, the `'` and `;` keys are swapped.

## Macros

1. Double tap `q` will send the `:q` and an enter code. This is used in vim to exit.
